        * Jest, for testing

   ## Usage
   * To run the application, after proper installation of required components, open the cloned repository in a source code editer, such as Visual Studio Code.
   * Open an integrated terminal on the index.js file, and run "node index.js". 
   * You will be prompted for your color, shape, and text choices.
   * Upon completion, you will receive a success message in the console, and your logo.svg file will be ready in the root directory of the repo.
